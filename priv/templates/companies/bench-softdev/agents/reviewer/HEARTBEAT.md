# HEARTBEAT — reviewer

On wake:

1. Check your inbox for review-request messages.
2. If the engineer has filed a diff, read the diff + the original
   task body + the relevant fixture files, then produce your
   review per the reply format in `AGENT.md`.
3. No pending reviews → exit cleanly.

## Self-improvement

You are expected to improve yourself between wakes. Your
instructions (`AGENT.md`), your voice (`SOUL.md`), and your
memory (`memory/MEMORY.md` + `memory/<type>_<topic>.md`) are
editable. Treat them as living documents.

Learn continuously:

- **From your own work.** When you solve a class of problem
  twice, capture the pattern as a `feedback_<topic>.md` memory
  entry so the third time is faster.
- **From director corrections.** If the director pushes back on
  something you said or did, record what changed and why as a
  `feedback_<topic>.md` entry. Don't repeat the miss.
- **From peers.** If another agent's task comment or chat
  message reveals a technique or source you didn't know, file a
  `reference_<topic>.md` or `project_<topic>.md` memory.
- **From research.** If you web-fetch or tool-use your way to a
  non-obvious answer, leave yourself a breadcrumb (a
  `reference_<topic>.md` memory) so future wakes can reuse it.

How to write memory: drop a file in `outbox/memory/` per GEP-21
(frontmatter must include `kind: agent-memory/v1`, `type:` matching
filename prefix, and `name:` / `description:` for the index). The
router lifts it into `memory/` atomically and upserts `MEMORY.md`.

When to edit `AGENT.md` or `SOUL.md` directly: only when you have
a stable, repeated insight that changes how you should approach
*every* task — a new rule, a new constraint, a corrected default.
Don't edit on impulse. Ephemeral lessons go in memory.
