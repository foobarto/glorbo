# Changelog

All notable changes to Glorbo will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Pre-1.0 caveat: APIs, CLI flags, on-disk layout, and SQLite schema may
change between minor versions. Pin exact versions in downstream usage.

## [Unreleased]

_Next milestone to be scoped via `/gsd-new-milestone`. Likely focus: container
runtime restoration (Python + Podman + POSIX ACLs), Gate→Agent.Server wake
forward, `api-only` netns + nftables egress hardening._

## [0.0.2] — 2026-04-16

Closes Milestone 01 (CLI-agent runtime) by shipping the dashboard and full CLI
surface on top of the v0.0.1 Phases 1-3 foundation. 5 phases / 20 plans / 219
commits / 621 tests green / 38-of-38 v0.0.2 requirements covered. See
`.planning/milestones/v0.0.2-ROADMAP.md` and `.planning/v0.0.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`.

### Phase 5 — CLI Completeness + Backup/Restore Portability

#### Added

- Lifecycle verbs: `glorbo up` (detached daemon via `setsid`), `down`
  (SIGTERM → 10s grace → SIGKILL escalation), `status` (pidfile state
  machine: running/stale/missing), `serve` (foreground-blocking
  supervision tree start), and `run` (one-shot `reindex`-like scripts).
- Pidfile with atomicity invariants: `tmp + chmod 0600 + rename` write,
  fsync on close, mode-bit enforcement, TOCTOU re-check against the
  daemon pid at every lifecycle verb boundary.
- Scaffolding verbs: `new company <slug>`, `new agent <company>/<slug>`,
  `new project <company>/<slug>`. Slug regex guards against path
  traversal; default frontmatter matches DESIGN.md §5.
- `logs <company> [agent] [--follow]` with inotify-backed live tail;
  audit-log or `stdout.log` selection; rotation-aware (handles
  `YYYY-MM.jsonl` rollover without raising).
- `backup [--output <path>]`: WAL-checkpoint via
  `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` before archiving; `tar.gz` over
  `~/.glorbo/companies/`, `config.md`, and audit log; pidfile
  TOCTOU re-check between checkpoint and `:erl_tar.create`; chmod
  0600 on output; archive-bomb cap at 10 GiB uncompressed sum.
- `restore <archive> [--force]`: pre-extract traversal guard rejects
  entries starting with `/` or containing `..`; archive-size cap
  enforced from verbose tar table; post-extract symlink-target walk
  via `:file.read_link/1` rejects any symlink escaping the restore
  base (CR-01); post-extract chain `migrate → reindex → doctor --fix`
  (D-22); `:non_empty_base` guard bypassed only with `--force`.
- `console`: `iex --name console@127.0.0.1 --cookie <cookie> --remsh
  glorbo@127.0.0.1` against the running daemon; pidfile-gated
  (exit 3 if daemon not running); cookie read from
  `~/.glorbo/state/.erl_cookie` (mode 0600, atomic write).
- `migrate`: `Ecto.Migrator.run(Glorbo.Repo, _, :up, all: true)` with
  `rescue` for migration errors and `catch :exit` for Ecto exit signals
  (lock-contention / connection-pool failures surface as exit 2).
- `doctor --fix`: severity-weighted exit code (0 / 1 / 2), registry of
  7 fixers (`ollama_daemon`, `runtime_image`, `podman_missing`,
  `podman_socket`, `sqlite_wal`, `pidfile_stale`, `audit_dir_mode`),
  check→fix→recheck pattern; only counts `repaired` if recheck passes;
  missing-fixer for blocker checks returns non-zero.
- End-to-end portability test (`test/integration/portability_test.exs`):
  two-root A→archive→B extract + migrate + reindex + fixer roundtrip
  with hermetic hosts.
- Distribution release uses long-name node (`-name glorbo@127.0.0.1`)
  in `rel/vm.args.eex` to support `console` remsh (short-name rejected
  by BEAM when qualified with host).

#### Security

- **CR-01** — symlink-target path-traversal bypass: archives with benign
  entry names but escaping `linkname` no longer extract successfully;
  post-extract walker wipes partially-extracted base if any symlink
  resolves outside `~/.glorbo/`.
- **WR-03** — archive-bomb DoS vector closed: restore refuses archives
  whose uncompressed entry sizes sum above the 10 GiB cap.
- **WR-04** — backup pidfile TOCTOU closed: daemon-restart between
  `ensure_down` and `write_archive` now aborts the backup.
- **WR-07** — `Restore.maybe_fixer` no longer swallows doctor-fix
  errors silently; failures surface via `Logger.warning/1` with
  structured reason while preserving the `:ok` contract.
- `Config.write_default!` and `Config.erl_cookie` use
  tmp-write → chmod 0600 → atomic rename (closes write-then-chmod
  race that exposed the cookie at umask-default mode).

### Phase 4 — LiveView Dashboard + Real-Time Channels

#### Added

- Phoenix LiveView on `:4000` with 8 views: company overview, kanban
  board, agent detail with live `stdout.log` streaming, chat, approval
  queue, audit viewer, system health, and settings.
- Phoenix Channels + PubSub wired end-to-end to `file_system` (inotify)
  events — `~/.glorbo/companies/` mutations repaint the dashboard in
  under one second with no polling.
- Append-only channel markdown files with Elixir as the sole writer;
  browser POSTs route through the Channel controller which validates
  and appends; frontmatter `status:` transitions are frontmatter-first
  (file is truth).
- `@agent-name` mention posted to a channel wakes the named agent via
  the Router; approval-queue one-click approve/reject updates the task
  file's `status:` frontmatter and fires the wake.
- `GlorboWeb.Layouts.app` default layout wired for all LiveViews.

### Tests / Infrastructure

- 621/621 unit tests green. 52 integration tests excluded-by-default
  (require live host deps: `inotify-tools`, Podman, Ollama, real
  network, real `setsid`).
- `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` clean.
- Code review (standard depth) produced 1 Critical + 15 Warnings + 12
  Info across two rounds; all Critical + Warning findings closed
  (see `.planning/phases/05-cli-completeness-backup-restore-portability/05-REVIEW-FIX.md`).
- Milestone audit: 38/38 requirements covered, no integration gaps.
  10 human-verify items tracked as pre-release checklist (non-blocking).

## [0.0.1] — 2026-04-16 (unreleased)

First cut of the CLI-agent runtime milestone. Tag pending the first
`v0.0.1-rc1` signed release.

### Phase 3 — CLI Agent Runtime + bwrap Isolation + Routing + Budgets

#### Added

- Per-company OTP supervision tree with crash isolation: an agent
  crash restarts only that agent; a company crash restarts only
  that company's agents; dashboard and other companies unaffected.
- Inotify-driven inbox/outbox routing. Elixir is the only writer to
  `inbox/`; agents are the only writer to `outbox/`. Cross-agent
  messages are Router-mediated — no agent touches another agent's
  files directly.
- CLI agent adapters for **Claude Code** (`claude -p`), **Gemini
  CLI** (`gemini -p`), and **Codex CLI** (`codex exec -`). Session
  state + credentials `--ro-bind`ed from the Director's home into
  each sandbox via provider-specific env redirects
  (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, etc.).
- `bwrap(1)` sandboxing for every agent wake. Baseline:
  `--die-with-parent --unshare-user-try --unshare-ipc --unshare-pid
  --unshare-uts --unshare-cgroup-try --new-session --cap-drop ALL`.
  Workspace bind-mounted `rw`; outbox `rw`; inbox `ro`;
  per-permission mounts spliced in from `agent.md` frontmatter.
- Three-value network policy enforced by kernel:
  - `none` — `--unshare-net` (egress physically blocked).
  - `api-only` — inherits host netns; `HTTPS_PROXY` + `HTTP_PROXY`
    point at a `Glorbo.Network.Proxy` listener with a hostname
    allowlist (advisory).
  - `open` — inherits host netns; no proxy.
- Per-agent monthly budgets with JSONL usage ledger, dashboard
  alerts, and hard-stop at cap.
- Skills injection: `.glorbo/skills/` markdown files discoverable
  and attachable per-agent via frontmatter.
- Director approval gates: tasks with `requires_approval: director`
  frontmatter pause until the Director explicitly approves.
- Append-only `audit/YYYY-MM.jsonl` per company. Action vocabulary
  fixed in `AUDIT_EVENTS.md`. Mode bits prevent group/other write.
- Permission model: two-layer enforcement by design. Elixir Router
  (application) and bwrap mounts (kernel). Extending to POSIX ACLs
  inside Podman containers in v0.0.2.

#### Security

- **SEC-03** (`--unshare-net` kernel-enforced egress block) validated
  on Fedora 43 dev host: `curl --max-time 3 https://api.anthropic.com`
  inside a `network: none` sandbox returns exit 7 with no packet
  ever leaving the host.

### Phase 2 — Filesystem Foundation + Container Runtime + Local LLM

#### Added

- `glorbo init` bootstrap: verifies deps, materialises `~/.glorbo/`
  hierarchy, prepares (deferred) Podman/Ollama integration
  scaffolding, writes the initial config.
- `~/.glorbo/` directory hierarchy per `DESIGN.md` §3:
  `companies/`, `containers/`, `bin/`, `models/`, `audit/`,
  `sockets/`, `state/`, `config.md`, `glorbo.db`.
- `glorbo doctor` extended with 8 new checks: `podman`, `ollama`,
  `ollama_daemon`, `runtime_image`, `runtime_exec`, `audit_dir`,
  `sockets_dir`, `tar_zstd`. Severity-weighted exit code (0 /
  warning / blocker).
- `glorbo reindex` rebuilds SQLite state fully from markdown/JSONL
  on disk. The SQLite DB is derived data — delete anytime.
- Append-only system audit log at `audit/_system/YYYY-MM.jsonl`
  recording `init.step.*` actions during bootstrap.
- Podman + Ollama + `glorbo-runtime` container design preserved
  for restoration in v0.0.2; dormant in v0.0.1 codebase
  (`.planning/deferred/container-runtime-v0.0.2/`).

### Phase 1 — Compilable Skeleton + CI Release Pipeline

#### Added

- Elixir 1.18.4 / OTP 28.0.2 toolchain, pinned via `.tool-versions`.
- Phoenix 1.8 skeleton with SQLite WAL (`ecto_sqlite3`), trimmed
  of esbuild/tailwind/heroicons scaffolding (reintroduced in
  Phase 4).
- `mix glorbo.doctor` CLI skeleton with 5 baseline checks:
  `linux_kernel`, `uidmap`, `disk_space`, `glorbo_dir`,
  `erts_version`.
- `/health` endpoint (replaces generated `/` home page).
- `Burrito`-packaged single-binary release pipeline for Linux
  x86_64 and aarch64, with bundled ERTS and Zig cross-toolchain.
- GitHub Actions CI matrix: compile-as-errors, test, Credo
  strict, format check, release build, binary smoke test, artifact
  upload.
- Cosign keyless signing (Sigstore OIDC) on tagged `v*.*.*`
  releases. `SHA256SUMS` + `.sig` per artifact.
- SQLite WAL journal mode enabled in `dev.exs`, `test.exs`,
  `runtime.exs` (FND-02).
- Credo strict mode with project-specific tunings
  (`CyclomaticComplexity` to 20 for dispatch-table functions,
  `Nesting` to 3, `AliasUsage` threshold relaxed).

### Infrastructure — Repository hygiene

#### Added

- `README.md` with Glorbo brand logo, OSS badges (CI, release,
  license, Elixir/OTP, platform, security, PRs, last-commit),
  and phase-accurate v0.0.1 scoping.
- `SECURITY.md` — vulnerability reporting policy tailored for
  Glorbo's sandbox-as-trust-boundary threat model. GitHub Private
  Vulnerability Reporting as primary channel; 72h ack, 90-day
  coordinated disclosure, safe harbor clause.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — dev setup, PR flow, Conventional Commits,
  quality gates, DESIGN.md invariants, review checklist.
- `LICENSE` — Apache License 2.0.

#### Changed

- Dropped Python-in-Podman agent runtime from v0.0.1 scope
  (deferred to v0.0.2). DESIGN.md and README now annotate the
  shift explicitly. The dormant container design is preserved at
  `.planning/deferred/container-runtime-v0.0.2/` for restoration.

#### Fixed (CI pipeline)

- Replaced `${@:3}` bash-ism in bwrap launcher shell with POSIX
  `shift 2; exec "$b" "$@" < "$p"` — Ubuntu's `/bin/sh` is dash
  and rejected the array slice.
- Installed unconfined AppArmor profile for `/usr/bin/bwrap` on
  Ubuntu 24.04 runners to work around
  `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1`, which blocked
  `--unshare-net` loopback setup with `RTM_NEWADDR: Operation not
  permitted`.
- Installed `bubblewrap` package on CI runners (not default on
  ubuntu-24.04).
- Removed invalid `E` regex modifier in `config/dev.exs`
  live_reload patterns — Elixir 1.18 parses strict modifiers.
- Loosened smoke-test `.checks | length` assertion from `== 5` to
  `>= 5` to stay resilient as phases add doctor probes (Phase 1:
  5; Phase 2: +8; Phase 3: +2; total 16).
- Guarded the "unknown-command exits 1" smoke assertion against
  `bash -e` — the `( cmd; ec=$?; test ... )` subshell tripped
  errexit before capturing the exit code.
